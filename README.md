# Object-Oriented Programming (Java)

*New York University – College of Arts and Science*

## Course Context

This repository contains coursework from **CSCI-UA 470: Object-Oriented Programming** at NYU.
The class focused on the principles of **object-oriented design** in Java, covering encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and modular design.

Assignments included small-scale implementations to reinforce OOP concepts, culminating in a **capstone group project**, [MyPersonalizedFitnessTracker](https://github.com/rren4000/MyPersonalizedFitnessTracker), which can be found in a separate repository.

**Tech Stack:** Java · Standard Java Libraries

## Project Highlights

### Coursework in This Repository

* **Address Book Application** — A Java program modeling an address book using classes for `Contact` and `AddressBook`, supporting structured storage, retrieval, and basic manipulation of contact data.

### Final Project (External Repository)

* **MyPersonalizedFitnessTracker** ([GitHub Link](https://github.com/rren4000/MyPersonalizedFitnessTracker))
  A multi-feature Java application to help users track fitness goals, calorie intake, body mass index (BMI), basal metabolic rate (BMR), and activities.

  * **Core Features:**

    * **Activity Tracking:** Manage and store physical activities with duration and calorie burn.
    * **Goal Management:** Set and track personal health/fitness goals.
    * **Calorie Tracking:** Input and monitor daily caloric intake.
    * **BMI/BMR Calculations:** Compute BMI and BMR using user-entered data, with file-based persistence.
  * **Design:** Modular Java classes with separate handlers for calculations, data storage, and user input.
  * **Documentation:** Includes team project proposal, UML diagrams, and a final report.

## Skills Developed

* **Core Java OOP**: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* **Modular Design**: organizing large applications into cohesive, reusable components.
* **Data Handling**: reading, writing, and persisting structured data in files.
* **Collaborative Development**: coordinating a multi-class, multi-feature Java application in a team setting.
* **UML & Design Documentation**: planning and presenting object-oriented architecture.

## Portfolio Note

This repository is part of my academic and professional coding portfolio.
It demonstrates both small-scale Java OOP exercises and a fully developed final project applying object-oriented design to a real-world problem.
